# Tang Nano 9K board build (Gowin GW1NR-9C)

First physical target for BradCore (Falcon). This directory holds the board
top-level, its pin constraints, a yosys `synth_gowin` script, and two
testbenches — one for the RTL, one for the synthesized netlist.

**Status: DESIGNED + SYNTHESIZED + GATE-LEVEL VERIFIED. Not yet
`RUNS_ON_REAL_GATES`.** Synthesis onto Gowin primitives succeeds, the netlist
simulates correctly against yosys's own cell models, and the design fits the
part with ~80% of its LUTs free — but no bitstream has been generated and no
board has been plugged in. See [What is still missing](#what-is-still-missing).

## Board facts

From Sipeed's own `TangNano-9K-example` constraints, cross-checked against
independent references:

| Signal | Pin | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| `sys_clk` | 52 | 27 MHz onboard oscillator |
| `sys_rst_n` | 4 | button S1, active-LOW |
| `led[5:0]` | 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 | **active-LOW**, common anode — invert once at the pin |

The LEDs being active-low is why the top ends with `assign led = ~led_r;`.

## The boot program

Real BradISA machine code in an on-chip ROM — the same encodings the CI
testbench runs, so the board is executing the proved CPU, not a stub:

```
0x00  ADDI r1, r0, 0     0x81000000   init counter
0x04  ADDI r1, r1, 1     0x81100001   loop: r1++
0x08  ADDI r2, r0, 0x04  0x82000004   r2 = data address
0x0C  STW  [r2], r1      0xA0210000   publish the counter
0x10  JMP  0x04          0xD000FFFC   back to the loop
```

The core publishes the counter by storing it to data memory; the top-level
latches `dmem_wdata` on a write and shows the low six bits on the LEDs. So the
visible count is the CPU's register value travelling out through a real memory
write, not a pattern generator pretending to be a CPU.

At 27 MHz this loop would run ~13 million times a second, so `core_clk` is
divided down to one cycle per 0.5 s. Each pass of the loop lands about every
2 seconds: a counter you can actually read with your eyes.

## Running it

```sh
# Board-level simulation (seconds, not minutes)
make sim_board        # from rtl/fpga/ — needs iverilog

# Gowin synthesis (real cell counts)
make gowin            # from rtl/fpga/ — needs yosys
```

`make sim_board` builds with `-DBRAD_FAST_SIM`, which shrinks only the clock
divider constant. The shipped design keeps the real 0.5 s divider, because that
is correct for the board and no simulation can wait for it.

The testbench does not just check "the LEDs moved". It checks that the
published sequence is exactly `1, 2, 3, …` with zero errors, so a core that
stopped counting, published garbage, or never published at all would all fail.

## Measured synthesis results

`yosys 0.52`, `synth_gowin`, yosys stat after mapping. Device is GW1NR-9C:
**8,640 LUT4, 6,480 FF, 26 BSRAM (468 Kb), 20 × 18×18 multipliers.**

Count LUT4s, not cells. The default flow emits `MUX2_LUT5..8` cells, which look
like fat multi-LUT4 consumers and are not — each is a wide-LUT optimisation that
still occupies exactly one LUT4. Adding `-nowidelut` forces the design down to
plain LUT4s, so the cell count *is* the fabric count:

| Design | LUT4 | FF | % of device LUTs |
|--------|------|----|------------------|
| Full board top | **~1,700–1,900** | 240 | **~22%** |
| The 32×32 `MUL` on its own | 1,330 | 0 | 78% of the design's LUTs |
| Same design, `MUL` removed (probe only) | 507 | 240 | 6% |

**The design fits the GW1NR-9C with roughly 80% of its LUTs unused.** The
multiply is the single biggest cost at 1,330 LUT4 — 78% of the logic — so it is
the obvious optimisation target, but it is not a blocker. For scale: the whole
rest of the core, register file, boot ROM, RAM, divider and LED logic together is
507 LUT4 and 240 flops.

The top-level figure is a range, not a constant: abc9's mapping is not perfectly
reproducible, and CI measured 1,707 where a local run gave 1,776 and another
1,854. It is a budget check, not a golden number, and `make gowin_fit` is what
enforces it.

The one thing yosys's Gowin flow cannot do is infer a DSP. `*` becomes LUT logic
because `synth_gowin` has no multiplier mapping, even though the part carries 20
18×18 blocks. That is a missed optimisation, not a capacity problem.

Two honest caveats:

- These are for **this boot program**. The counter touches two registers, so
  yosys prunes the other fourteen — hence 240 FFs, not 512. A program using all
  16 registers costs more, and a real one will also want more memory.
- Gate-level simulation below is proof the netlist *computes*, not proof it
  routes. Utilisation says there is room; only place-and-route and a board say
  it works.

## Gate-level verification

`make sim_gate` synthesises the design to Gowin primitives and then simulates
**that netlist** against yosys's own behavioural models of the Gowin cells
(`cells_sim.v`), checking the LED value walks 1, 2, 3, … with zero errors.

This is the step that catches a synthesis bug rather than an RTL bug. It runs
against a build whose divider constant is shrunk via `chparam` — same logic,
different timing constant — and currently reports **96 LED steps, 0 sequence
errors, final count 32**, identically to the RTL testbench.

So the design is no longer only "it elaborates". It is "the gates yosys produced
count correctly."

## CI gates for this board

Four, all in the `FPGA (Tang Nano 9K / yosys synth_gowin)` job:

| Step | What it refuses to let through |
|------|--------------------------------|
| `sim_board` | an RTL boot program that doesn't drive a correct counting sequence |
| `sim_gate` | a design that breaks when synthesized into gates |
| netlist check | a yosys run that produces no netlist at all |
| `gowin_fit` | a design that outgrows the GW1NR-9C's LUT4/FF budget |

`gowin_fit` is the one added in response to getting the fit estimate wrong by
roughly 5×. It is a real guard, not a decoration: run it with
`GOWIN_LUT_BUDGET=1000` and it fails.

## What is still missing

1. **A bitstream.** This is now the honest blocker. The design fits the part and
   the synthesized netlist computes correctly, but GW1N place-and-route needs
   nextpnr-himbaechel, Apicula, or Gowin EDA, and none is in CI. `synth_gowin`
   deliberately stops at synthesis.
2. **A board.** Until a bitstream is on real silicon and a person watches the
   LEDs count, the honest tag is DESIGNED + SYNTHESIZED + GATE-LEVEL VERIFIED.
   The `RUNS_ON_REAL_GATES` badge stays unflipped.
3. **A DSP-aware multiply.** An optimisation, not a blocker. At 1,330 LUT4 the
   multiply is 78% of the logic, and `synth_gowin` cannot infer a DSP. A
   hand-built 18×18 decomposition, or a `$mul` a prjtrellis-himbaechel flow
   claims as a hard block, would hand most of that back and free the LUTs for
   real program memory and a full register file.
4. **Real program memory.** The core reads instruction memory
   combinationally, so this build uses a small distributed ROM (16 words). Real
   program memory wants a synchronous BSRAM port, which means a matching core
   change — a design step, not a config tweak. Note this is the change most
   likely to be needed next, and the freed LUTs from (3) are what pay for it.
